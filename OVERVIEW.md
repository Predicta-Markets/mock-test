# Project Overview

## What Is This?

**Capital Gains** is a **prediction market platform** - a web application where you can create markets, trade shares, and resolve outcomes.

Think of it like a stock market for future events. Instead of buying shares in companies, you buy shares in whether something will happen or not.

## Simple Example

**Market Question**: "Will it rain tomorrow?"

- You can buy **YES shares** (betting it WILL rain) at, say, 60 cents
- Or buy **NO shares** (betting it WON'T rain) at 40 cents
- If it rains: YES shares pay 100 cents, NO shares pay 0 cents
- If it doesn't rain: NO shares pay 100 cents, YES shares pay 0 cents

The prices change based on what people think will happen!

## What Can You Do?

1. ✅ **Create Markets** - Ask any yes/no question
2. ✅ **Buy Shares** - Invest in YES or NO outcomes
3. ✅ **Sell Shares** - Exit your position anytime
4. ✅ **Track Profits** - See your gains and losses
5. ✅ **Resolve Markets** - Determine winners and payouts

## How Does It Work?

### The Basics

- Every market has **two sides**: YES and NO
- Prices always add up to **100 cents** (if YES = 70, NO = 30)
- You can **buy** shares (if you think the price will go up)
- You can **sell** shares (if you want to take profits or exit)
- When the event happens, the market **resolves** and pays out

### The Trading System

When you place an order:
1. The system tries to **match** you with someone on the other side
2. If matched, you trade immediately at the best available price
3. If not matched, your order waits in the **order book** for later
4. Prices **update automatically** based on completed trades

### Position Tracking

The system remembers:
- How many shares you own (YES and NO separately)
- What you paid on average (weighted average cost)
- Your profit/loss from trades you've made
